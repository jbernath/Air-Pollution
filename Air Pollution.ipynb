The goal of this notebook is to take one variable that measures air pollution: PM2.5 concentration, which is  2.5 micrometer or smaller from WRF; and compare it to real station data at similar locations and time. Using mesowest API we are able to collect data from mesowest's database that contains PM2.5 concentrations from hundreds of weather stations across the western United States over many years. After carefully obtaining and cleaning this data, we use it to compare forecasted concentrations from WRF, using both graphical comparison and statistical comparisons over both space and time.\n","The tools and software used to complete this analysis will be explained, as well as providing numerical and graphical summaries.

WRF and WRF-SFIRE can forecast a variety of variables for wildfires and weather over a given time and region. The model is complex with numerous inputs and outputs but for this project we are only concered with air pollution. More specifically, pm2.5 concentration, or air pollutants less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers. Air pollution is a serious problem, not only because it can affect other aspect of the WRF model and it accuracy, but also is a danger to human health. The WRF and WRF-SFIRE models go through various testing on a case by case basis to learn more about the accuracy of the models.With this notebook, we offer a tool for inputing WRF netcdf output and then having the ability to see the difference between WRF forecasted values and a station's observation included in the forecast region over the time region.  To improve models, it must be known what is the problem with the current model and this notebook may provide insights. Previous studies have found that $PM_{2.5}$ conceration have been underestimates but also doens't have similar peaks (Konchanski, 540).

We are interested in $R^2$ values to see how well the polynomial regression fits in the data and the accuracy of our prediction. When comparing the statistics for three stations and WRF, we can observe that overall the $R^2$ results are much higher for the stations than for WRF. Hence, the polynomial regression fits better the data for the stations than for WRF since it has the strongest relationship between the time and pm2.5 concentration.\n","\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","According to the graphs that compare WRF to the weather stations, the interpolated values of WRF against the concentration show more variability (see the peaks of the graphs), which tends to underestimate the data in comparison to the data point or the number of observations we have. This may be due to estimation errors and it may lead to misinterpretations of the data. There is no such perfect model when predicting weather observations data. However, based on our results, the weather stations seem to have better management and accuracy of the data compared to WRF data.\n","\n","Due to the numerous variables that WRF forecasts and stations obtain data on this notebook could be altered or scaled to include variables of the users choice. Gathering numerous variables together would allow for much stronger analysis to be done.
